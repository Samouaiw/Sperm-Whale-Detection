# Sperm-Whale-Detection

1- run cachalots_coh.m to create .mat files in which are recorded the computed coherence
2- run cachalots_P0P1.m to create .mat files in which are recorded the click detections
3- run cachalots_concatene.m to create a .mat files in which signal portions of click detections are recorded
4- run cachalots_concatene_figures.m to visualize click echoes time evolution and analyse sperm-whale behaviour

cachalots_concatene_2 does both 3- and 4-


figures to illustrate the coherence signal processing are obtained using cachalots_coh_figures.m

figures to illustrate the coherence filtering are obtained using cachalots_P0P1_figures.m
